Here’s a comprehensive, streamlined business process for your modular cabinet showroom operation in the Philippines, focusing on outsourcing/local sourcing and importation for large projects:

---

### **Core Business Process Overview**
1. **Customer Acquisition** → **Design & Quotation** → **Procurement (Local/Import)** → **Installation** → **After-Sales Support**

---

### **Workflow & Process Flow**
#### **Phase 1: Customer Engagement & Design**
1. **Showroom Visit/Sales Inquiry**  
   - SOP: Greet customer, assess needs (space, budget, style).  
   - Tool: Modulux CRM to log contact details and preferences.  
   - Estimate: Price quote based on Modulux's standard rates.

2. **3D Design & Quotation**  
   - SOP: Draft designs in Coohom and run 3D nesting in Mozaik, then compile an itemized quote listing materials, sizes, and lead time.  
   - Quotation: Keep the final price within ±5–10 % of the preliminary estimate.  
   - Output: Send a digital proposal plus a physical mock-up when required.

#### **Phase 2: Procurement**
**A. Local Sourcing (Small/Medium Projects):**  
- Identify approved fabricators (e.g., in Manila/Cebu) via vetting (quality samples, pricing, capacity).  
- Place order with PO specifying:  
  - Materials (plywood, laminates), dimensions, finish, hardware.  
  - Inspection clause (pre-shipment QC by your team or third party).  
- Track production via weekly updates; inspect final units before shipment.  

**B. Importation (Large Projects e.g., Condos):**  
- Source from Chinese manufacturers (Alibaba, trade shows).  
- **SOP: Import Workflow**  
  1. Request samples → Approve design/materials.  
  2. Negotiate Incoterms (e.g., FOB Shanghai), payment terms (30% deposit, 70% before shipment).  
  3. Arrange shipping (sea freight) via freight forwarder; track via Bill of Lading (BL).  
  4. Customs clearance (file entry, pay duties/taxes via broker).  
  5. Warehouse receipt → Final QC → Delivery to site.  

#### **Phase 3: Installation**
- Assign certified installers (subcontractors) with toolkits.  
- SOP: Pre-installation site survey → Secure materials → Install per blueprint → Client sign-off.  

#### **Phase 4: After-Sales Support**
- Warranty period (e.g., 1–2 years) for defects.  
- SOP: Log complaints → Inspect → Repair/replacement within 7 days.  

---

### **Key SOPs & Procedures**
#### **1. Supplier Management SOP**  
- **Vetting:** Check licenses, ISO certifications, client references.  
- **Contract Template:** Include quality standards, lead times, penalties for delays.  
- **Payment Terms:** 50% deposit, balance upon QC approval.  

#### **2. Quality Control SOP**  
- **Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI):** For imports/local, hire third-party inspectors (e.g., SGS) to verify specs.  
- **Receiving Checklist:** Inspect for damage, correct dimensions, finish quality.  

#### **3. Inventory & Logistics SOP**  
- **Warehouse:** Rent secure space near showroom; label bins by project.  
- **Delivery Schedule:** Coordinate with transport partners; use GPS tracking.  

#### **4. Documentation SOP**  
- Maintain records: Quotes, POs, BLs, invoices, warranties.  
- Digital storage (Google Drive, SharePoint) with access controls.  

#### **5. Customer Communication SOP**  
- Update clients weekly via email/WhatsApp on order status.  
- Escalate unresolved issues to management within 24 hours.  

---

### **Tools & Technology Recommendations**
- **CRM:** Modulux CRM (track leads, automate quotes).  
- **Project Mgmt:** Modulux Project Management Tool (manage design-to-delivery tasks).  
- **Accounting:** Xero/QuickBooks (invoices, expenses, tax compliance).  
- **Communication:** Slack (team coordination), WhatsApp (client updates).  

---

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Supplier Diversification:** Work with 2–3 local fabricators + 1 backup importer.  
2. **Currency Hedging:** Use forward contracts for PHP payments to China.  
3. **Insurance:** Cargo insurance for imports; liability insurance for installations.  
4. **Contingency Fund:** Allocate 10% of project costs for delays/damage.  

---

### **Scalability Plan**
- **Year 1:** Focus on local projects; build supplier network.  
- **Year 2:** Expand import volume; negotiate bulk discounts.  
- **Long-Term:** Consider partial in-house assembly to reduce costs.

To refine your **3D Design & Quotation** process with a downpayment structure, here’s an updated workflow, SOPs, and rationale—focused on securing commitment while delivering value:


### **Revised Workflow: From Inquiry to Design Commitment**
| Step | Action | Key Outputs | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1. **Initial Consultation** | Discuss customer needs (space, style, budget). Provide rough "ballpark" estimate (verbal/written). | Rough estimate (e.g., "PHP 150k–200k for a standard kitchen") | 30 mins |
| 2. **Downpayment Collection** | Collect **25% of the *projected total*** (or a fixed fee, e.g., PHP 5k–10k) to initiate conceptualization. <br> *Note: 25% is fair for design-only work in the PH market.* | Signed Design Agreement + Payment Receipt | Immediate (within 48 hrs of inquiry) |
| 3. **Conceptualization** | Create basic sketches/mood boards (digital or hand-drawn) to visualize layout, color scheme, and material options. | Mood Boards / Basic Layout Sketches | 3–5 days |
| 4. **Concept Approval** | Present concepts to customer. Revise until aligned. | Approved Concept Document | 1–2 days (revisions included) |
| 5. **Detailed 3D Design** | Develop full 3D model (SketchUp/AutoCAD) with exact dimensions, finishes, and hardware. | Final 3D Render + Itemized Quote | 5–7 days |
| 6. **Final Quotation & Contract** | Issue binding quote (includes all costs, lead time, warranty). Sign contract. | Signed Contract + Final Invoice | 1 day |


### **Updated SOPs for 3D Design & Quotation**
#### **1. Downpayment Collection SOP**  
- **Amount**: 25% of the *initial ballpark estimate* (e.g., if the rough quote is PHP 180k, collect PHP 45k).  
  *Rationale*: Aligns payment with the value of design work (avoids free labor).  
- **Payment Method**: Bank transfer, check, or digital wallets (GCash/PayMaya). Issue a receipt immediately.  
- **Contract Clause**:  
  > *"Downpayment is non-refundable once conceptualization begins. Refunds apply only if the customer cancels before work starts (minus a 10% admin fee)."*  

#### **2. Conceptualization SOP**  
- **Tools**: Use Canva for mood boards or SketchUp for basic layouts. Keep it simple—no high-res renders yet.  
- **Deliverables**: 2–3 concept options (e.g., modern minimalist vs. rustic). Highlight key features (e.g., "island with breakfast bar," "soft-close drawers").  
- **Communication**: Send concepts via email/WhatsApp. Schedule a 30-min call to discuss revisions.  

#### **3. Detailed Design SOP**  
- **Scope**: Exact measurements, material specifications (e.g., "18mm plywood with matte white laminate"), hardware list (hinges, handles), and installation notes.  
- **Quote Breakdown**: Separate costs for cabinets, countertops, delivery, and installation. Include taxes and potential import duties (for future large projects).  
- **Timeline**: Finalize the quote within 7 days of concept approval.  

#### **4. Contract & Payment SOP**  
- **Contract Template**: Include:  
  - Scope of work (design + procurement/installation).  
  - Payment schedule (25% down, 50% pre-production, 25% post-installation).  
  - Lead time (e.g., "8 weeks from design approval").  
  - Dispute resolution (mediation/arbitration).  
- **Final Invoice**: Issue within 24 hours of contract signing.  


### **Why This Works for Your Business**  
1. **Secures Commitment**: The downpayment filters serious customers and funds early design work.  
2. **Reduces Risk**: Non-refundable clauses protect against "free design shopping."  
3. **Streamlines Workflow**: Phased design (concept → detail) avoids over-investing in unapproved ideas.  
4. **Aligns with PH Market Norms**: 25% downpayments are common for construction/design services (per DTI guidelines).  


### **Tools to Simplify**  
- **CRM**: HubSpot/Zoho to track payments, send automated invoices, and store contracts.  
- **Design Tools**: SketchUp (free version) for 3D models; Canva for mood boards.  
- **Payment Gateways**: Integrate GCash/PayMaya into your website for instant payments.  


### **Example Scenario**  
A customer inquires about a kitchen. You give a rough estimate of PHP 200k. They pay PHP 50k (25%) to start. You deliver mood boards in 4 days. They approve one option. You then create a detailed 3D model and quote of PHP 210k (including upgrades). They sign the contract and pay the next 50% (PHP 105k) to begin production.
