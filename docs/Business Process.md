### **Workflow & Process Flow**
#### **Phase 1: Customer Engagement & Design Commitment**
| Step | Action | Key Outputs | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1. **Initial Consultation** | Greet customer, assess needs (space, budget, style). Log in Modulux CRM. | Rough estimate (verbal/written) | 30 min |
| 2. **Down-payment Collection** | Collect **25 % of the projected total** (or PHP 5 k–10 k fixed fee) to unlock conceptualization. | Signed Design Agreement + Payment Receipt | Within 48 hrs |
| 3. **Conceptualization** | Create 2–3 mood boards / basic SketchUp layouts. | Mood Boards / Layout Sketches | 3–5 days |
| 4. **Concept Approval** | Present options; revise until aligned. | Approved Concept Document | 1–2 days |
| 5. **Detailed 3D Design & Quote** | Build full 3D model (Coohom/Mozaik) with exact dims, finishes, hardware. | Final 3D Render + Itemized Quote | 5–7 days |
| 6. **Final Contract & Invoice** | Issue binding quote (±5–10 % of preliminary estimate). Sign contract. | Signed Contract + Final Invoice | 1 day |

> **SOP Note:** Down-payment is non-refundable once conceptualization begins; refund only if cancelled before work starts (minus 10 % admin fee).

#### **Phase 2: Procurement**
**A. Local Sourcing (Small/Medium Projects)**  
- Use approved fabricators (Manila/Cebu) vetted via licenses, samples, capacity.  
- PO lists: materials (plywood, laminate), dims, finish, hardware, **inspection clause**.  
- Weekly production updates; pre-shipment QC by your team or third-party (e.g., SGS).  

**B. Importation (Large Projects)**  
- Source China manufacturers (Alibaba, trade shows).  
- **Import SOP:**  
  1. Request & approve samples.  
  2. Negotiate FOB Shanghai, 30 % deposit / 70 % before shipment.  
  3. Sea freight via forwarder; track BL.  
  4. Customs clearance with broker.  
  5. Warehouse receipt → Final QC → Site delivery.  

#### **Phase 3: Installation**
- Assign certified installers; pre-install site survey; install per blueprint; client sign-off.

#### **Phase 4: After-Sales Support**
- 1–2 yr warranty; log complaints → inspect → repair/replace within 7 days.

### **Key SOPs & Procedures**
