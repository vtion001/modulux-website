### **Project Rules for Modulux Website Improvement**

#### **1. Mid-End Development**
- **UI/UX Enhancements**:
  - Ensure consistent design across all pages (e.g., color schemes, typography, spacing).
  - Optimize responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
  - Improve animations and transitions for better user experience.
  - Add accessibility features (e.g., ARIA roles, skip links, focus styles).

- **Content Updates**:
  - Replace placeholder images with actual project images.
  - Update text content to reflect accurate project details and descriptions.
  - Ensure all pages have clear headings and structured content for readability.

#### **2. Back-End Development**
- **Data Management**:
  - Create or update APIs to fetch dynamic project details and images.
  - Implement a database or CMS for managing project data (e.g., titles, descriptions, images, services).

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Optimize server-side rendering (SSR) for faster page loads.
  - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
  - Minimize bundle size using code splitting and tree shaking.

- **SEO Improvements**:
  - Ensure meta tags, alt attributes, and structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) are properly implemented.
  - Update sitemap.xml and robots.txt for better search engine indexing.

#### **3. Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**
- **Placement**:
  - Ensure CTAs are prominently displayed on all pages (e.g., "Get Free Quote," "View Projects").
  - Use contrasting colors and clear text for visibility.

- **Functionality**:
  - Link CTAs to relevant pages or forms (e.g., contact form, project details).
  - Add tracking for CTA clicks using analytics tools.

- **Content**:
  - Use persuasive and action-oriented language (e.g., "Transform Your Space Today").
  - Highlight benefits or unique selling points near CTAs.

#### **4. Project Details and Images**
- **Image Updates**:
  - Replace placeholder images with high-quality, actual project images.
  - Ensure images are optimized for web (e.g., compressed without losing quality).

- **Project Information**:
  - Add detailed descriptions for each project (e.g., location, budget, materials used).
  - Include client testimonials and feedback where applicable.

- **Gallery and Carousel**:
  - Implement image carousels for showcasing multiple images per project.
  - Add zoom or lightbox functionality for better image viewing.

#### **5. Testing and Quality Assurance**
- **Cross-Browser Testing**:
  - Test the website on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
  - Ensure compatibility with older browser versions if necessary.

- **Performance Testing**:
  - Use tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest to measure page speed and performance.
  - Address any issues related to slow loading times or large assets.

- **User Testing**:
  - Conduct usability tests to gather feedback on navigation, content, and CTAs.
  - Iterate based on user feedback.

#### **6. Deployment**
- **Staging Environment**:
  - Set up a staging environment for testing changes before deploying to production.

- **Version Control**:
  - Use Git for tracking changes and collaborating with team members.
  - Ensure commits are well-documented and follow a consistent format.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry) to track user behavior and errors.
